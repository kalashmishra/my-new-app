                Yes, there are several lenders that approve your personal loan
                application even if you do not have income proof. For this, you
                can highlight additional income sources, maintain a high CIBIL
                score and even request someone to be a co-applicant or
                guarantor. Additionally, you should also maintain a good
                relationship with the lender to increase credit approval
                chances.
