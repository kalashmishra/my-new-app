                Usually, most banks and NBFCs offer personal loans at an
                interest rate ranging from 10.50% to 24.00% per annum. However,
                this might vary with the various factors that affect the
                interest rates. In order to get the actual personal loan
                interest rate, you should contact with your lender and enquire
                about the same with them.

                Even the slightest delay in repaying the monthly instalment will
                negatively affect your credit score. This will indicate poor
                repayment behaviour, reducing the chances of loan approvals in
                the long run. In order to reduce these complications, it is best
                to set a reminder and keep the money ready to pay before the EMI
                payment date.

                The rate of interest remains fixed throughout the repayment
                tenure in case of a fixed rate. On the other hand, the rate of
                interest keeps changing with the fluctuations in the market in
                the case of a floating interest rate. Willing borrowers should
                keep this thing in mind and choose the option that best suits
                their needs.
