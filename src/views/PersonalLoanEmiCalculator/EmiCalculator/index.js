                A personal loan is one of the most sought-after credit
                facilities available. This hike in popularity is due to the ease
                of its application process and higher approval rates. In the
                time of emergencies, the availability of funds matters the most
                to you than anything else.

                The repayment process can be a hassle-free affair if you plan it
                properly. This is why you should use a personal loan EMI
                calculator before you apply for the credit. Using this tool is
                extremely easy. You can figure out how much credit you should
                apply for so that you can comfortably pay it off.
              </Typography>
              <Typography sx={{ ...paraStyling }}>
                Personal loan interest rates are usually higher than the other
                types of credit facilities. This is due to the fact that it
                falls under the “unsecured loan” header. Higher interest means
                higher EMI outflow. Missing out on one EMI can lead to a hefty
                penalty payment. This will further enhance your loan's burden.

                How Does Online Personal Loan EMI Calculator Calculate Loan EMI?
              </Typography>
              <Typography sx={{ ...paraStyling }}>
                A personal loan EMI has two components:
              </Typography>
              <List>
                {loanemiData.map((item, index) => (
                  <ListItem key={index} sx={{ padding: 0, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
                    <ListItemText
                      primary={
                        <React.Fragment>
                          <FiberManualRecord sx={{ ...CircleIcon }} />
                          <Typography
                            component="span"
                            sx={{ ...ListItemTextTitle }}
                          >
                            {item.title}
                          </Typography>
                        </React.Fragment>
                      }
                    />

                The repayment procedure is not linear. Hence, calculating the
                EMI amount manually is not simple. However, there is a
                mathematical expression that you can use to figure it out. Take
                a look at the formula below:
              </Typography>
              <Typography sx={{ ...paraStyling }}>The formula –</Typography>

              <Typography sx={{ ...paraStyling, margin: 0 }}>
                N - Number of months
              </Typography>
              <Typography sx={{ ...paraStyling }}>
                Suppose, you have taken a <b>personal loan (P) of Rs.50,000.</b>{" "}
                The lender has levied interest at a rate of{" "}

              <Typography sx={{ ...paraStyling }}>
                Now, putting these values in the formula, we get –

              <Typography sx={{ ...ListItemTextTitle }}>
                EMI = [50,000 x 11 x (1+11)^24]/[(1+11)^24-1]
