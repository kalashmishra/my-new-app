                To safeguard your financial stability, it is advisable that you
                avoid taking a personal loan if you are facing situations as

                      Unstable Job:

                    If your employment and income are not stable, it is better
                    if you stop taking the personal loan. It may become
                    challenging for you to repay and get out of your debt
                    obligations in case of a sudden stop or decrease in the flow
                    of your income.

                    If you are already repaying your credit card bills and
                    instalments of other loans, you should avoid engaging in a
                    new financial obligation. You should keep an eye on your
                    debt-to-income ratio. An ideal debt-to-income ratio is 36%
                    or below that.

                    When your credit score is below the minimum eligibility
                    parameter, it is better if you work on improving that before
                    taking a personal loan. If you still apply, the chances are
                    that the lender will reject your loan application, leaving a
                    negative impact on your credit report.

                    </Typography>
                    The purpose of taking a personal loan should never be to
                    make an investment in the stock market, other risky
                    instruments or gambling. This is so because you can book
                    loss instead of gaining profit. Under such a circumstance,
                    it will become difficult for you to repay.
