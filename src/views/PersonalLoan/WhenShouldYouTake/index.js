                      If you have multiple loans, you need to remember the
                      scheduled date of all your loan instalments and pay them
                      separately. Now, if you go for debt consolidation, all
                      your existing obligations will be merged into one. So, you
                      can repay your outstanding debts by paying one instalment.
