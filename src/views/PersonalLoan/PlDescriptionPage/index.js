                Credmudra isn't a lender itself but connects borrowers with
                different lending partners. These partners offer personal loans
                with varying APRs, typically ranging from 11.29% to 35%. The
                actual rates may depend on the borrower's financial situation
                and loan requirements.

                Loan terms usually range from a few weeks to a maximum of 60
                months (5 years), but they can vary between lenders. It's
                important for borrowers to carefully review the loan agreement
                provided by the lender before accepting any offers. This
                agreement includes the final APR, fees, and specific terms and
                conditions, ensuring borrowers understand their financial
                obligations.
